Deployment Groups is a Cloudhub Entity that allows you to combine multiple regions together. After a Deployment Group is created multiple applications can be deployed to this deployment group. Deployment Group allows a single application to be deployed in an active-active state to multiple workers in multiple regions simultaneously.

Global Deploymemnt Entitlement is required to use this feature.

A Deployment Group can be shared between different environments in a business group.
