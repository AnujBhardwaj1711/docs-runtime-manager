In order to troubleshoot and provide better insights upon a malfunction of the Runtime Manager Agent installation, a new `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_debug` script is available.

If you experience any issue with the Runtime Manager Agent Plugin and/or with managing applications on the Anypoint platform, it's highly recommended to obtain the output of this script before filling any support tickets.

When you execute this script it will collect the following information that will help troubleshoot your issue:

. Discover Mule/agent JVM process
. Extract Thread dump (not forced if possible)
. Extract Heap dump
+
[CAUTION]
--
This step can cause delays in running applications.
--
+
. Extract machine generic data: Java version, CPU usage, Memory usage, Disk usage.
. Copy all logs
. Copy Runtime Manager Agent Configuration files
. ZIP all the information

After the script is executed, you can find a .zip file in the folder `$MULE_HOME/bin` (with a name similar to `snapshot_201701021410.zip`) that you can send to MuleSoft's support engineers to help troubleshoot your issues.
