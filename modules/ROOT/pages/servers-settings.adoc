The settings page contains the same information that's accesible on the right panel of the *Servers* section, with the addition of an *Alerts History* tab, that displays a record of the triggered alerts on this server. See xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts on Runtime Manager] for more on this.
