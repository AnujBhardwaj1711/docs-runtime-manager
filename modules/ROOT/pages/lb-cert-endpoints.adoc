By providing a certificate and private key pair, you can configure an SSL endpoint for your load balancer to serve to clients.
Each load balancer can have multiple and independent SSL endpoints. Each one is identified by their server certificate common name.

A dedicated load balancer must have at least one certificate associated to it.  This requires that at least one SSL endpoint must be configured when creating the load balancer.
